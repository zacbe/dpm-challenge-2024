# Exercise (Senior) Software Developer

## Description

Imagine a Single Page Web Application which is able to record spoken text as audio (mobile and desktop) and replay the recorded audio. The once recorded audio should be sent together with the email address of the user to a REST-API backend.
The backend API receives the audio and asynchronously processes it by an algorithm which corrects potential (grammatical) errors and produces a corrected audio. Once the audio is corrected, the backend API sends it back to the frontend, where it is displayed and can be played back by the user.

## Coding

Please make sure to invest not more than two hours. During these two hours decide which parts of the application you want to roughly sketch, create stubs for, etc. If you want you can also focus on one detail only and finish it during that time. In any case we want to see a bit of your code! And we are interested in your overall approach and architecture, and your thoughts and reasoning behind your decisions.

## Documentation

We are way more interested in your thoughts and reasoning process than in the final solution. So please make sure to document your decisions regarding

- technology stack
  - frontend framework
  - backend framework
- Architecture

## Delivery

Please provide us with a zip of your code or a link to a repository.

## Discussion

Prepare to discuss the software engineering aspects such as maintainability, extendability, stability, performance, security.
